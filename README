imagemash asksusers to rate pairs of images against each other.

imagemash expects to find its images in the images/ directory. It will
pick several unique pairs of image to show each user and record which of
the pair they chose.

Several parts of the output can be customised by filling in the files in
the template directory:
- template/head.html is included in the <head> of the document.
- template/header.html is included immediately inside the <body>.
- template/footer.html is included immediately before the </body>.
- template/thank-you.html is shown when users have rated all pairs.

imagemash is distributed under the GNU Affero General Public Licence,
version 3.0 or later. There is a link on every page to obtain the
running source code.

imagemash asks users to rate pairs of images against each other.

imagemash expects to find its images in the images/ directory. It will
pick several unique pairs of image to show each user and record which of
the pair they chose.

Results are recorded into results.txt in the format:
  side,number,winner,loser,sessionID
where the names are derived from the image filenames.

You can set what the images should be referred to ask, what property
you're asking about, and how many pairs to show each visitor in
config.php. Note that the last pair shown will be a one of the
pairs shown earlier (specified in config.php). 

Several parts of the output can be customised by filling in the files in
the template/ directory:
- template/first.html is included before the users have seen any pairs
- template/head.html is included in the <head> of the document.
- template/header.html is included immediately inside the <body>.
- template/footer.html is included immediately before the </body>.
- template/thank-you.html is shown when users have rated all pairs.
